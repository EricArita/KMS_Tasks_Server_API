# KMS_Todoist

--> KMS_Todoist is the repository for Tasks project. Tasks is the name of my web app that gives you feature to manage plan, schedule for your works, projects or daily tasks to do.
It supports to both personal and teamworks purposes. In near future, Code Management Repository is going to be develop and release soon !

--> Tasks project uses ReactJs + Redux for user app and Asp.Net Core Web Api 3.1 for backend. Onion Architecture + CQRS pattern is applied for backend so taking time to learn about it before enjoing my code
